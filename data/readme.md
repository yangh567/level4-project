  * *For downloading processed sbs x sample_id x gene mutation status matrix:
  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kk0PercSGP2-vewuwpFat-9zs5fixhzm/view?usp=sharing*

* Write scripts to produced processed data from these (e.g. tidy dataframes, excel sheets, csv files, HDF5 files, sqlite databases)
  (the processed data is processed with maftool and sigminer signature extrcator in R language with the TCGA data downloaded from TCGA platform)

* Write scripts that process these into results, visualisations, tables that you include in your project.
  (all the results are shown in the specific directory in each experiment folder)
