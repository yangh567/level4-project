# 9 oct 2020 Friday

we discussed the primary goal of the project
and we have discussed the papers to look at
to understand the works that have been done
by the formal peoples.

we discussed the communication channels and
the Version control tools to use.


# 23 oct 2020 Friday

we discussed the paper i have looked and.
we discussed about the algorithm that is
appropriate to use.


# 6 Nov 2020 Friday

we discussed what are the features to use
to classify on the cancer types and what
are the platform that we need to attend to.


# 20 Nov 2020 Friday

we discussed about the data that we need to use.
we discussed where to obtain the data.


# 4 Dec 2020 Friday

we discussed the way of extracting the feature.
we needed from the data we have and supervisor has
explained to me how to perform the NMF.


# 18 Dec 2020 Friday

i displayed the first outcome of classifying cancer
based on sbs signatures and rearrangement signatures
without using the data from TCGA platform.

we discussed the reasonably great accuracy.


# 18 Jan 2020 Monday

we discussed the next level is to validate the idea of using
those mutational signatures to predict on the gene to see
if we could build recommender system on recommending gene mutation status
of patients.

i proposed the way of deploying the graph convolutional neural network
to help with the gene prediction and it is complex and not suitable for
implementing on our current study.


# 25 Jan 2020 Monday

we discussed the problem of not having gene mutation status in the current data that
is not downloaded from TCGA platform and we discussed how to address the issue.


# 1 February 2020 Monday

i find the way to extract the sbs signature from the maf files downloaded from TCGA platform
by exploiting R language and the tool called sigminer and extracted teh gene mutation status
from each sample in the data.

i reported the approach to the supervisor and confirmed that i can work on this basis


# 22 February 2020 Monday

we discussed the different validation approach to validate on the cancer classification
and gene classification.

i introduced the model that i have built and the strategies that i have deployed to validate on the
classification and introduced the stratified sampling


# 1 March 2020 Monday

we duscussed the possible fake high accuracy on classifying gene mutation status and
supervisor has suggested that instead of classifying it all,we classify frequently mutated
gene's mutation status within each cancer


# 15 March 2020 Monday

we discuessed the final result of classification of gene mutation status and cancers
and we discussed the possible reason for negative result on the roc graph and auc.
we aggreed on forging the dissertation at this time.
