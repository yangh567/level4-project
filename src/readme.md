*  `classification-gene-feature-extraction` -- The validation experiment of classifying cancer types using sbs signatures and classify gene as well as analyse on ranking

   
*  `classification_cancer_gene_analysis` -- The validation experiment of classifying gene using the feature extracted from cancer classification


*  `individual-classification` -- Validate the idea that sbs signatures can be used to identify two cancers


*  `ml_method` -- The research on the HRDetect model 


*  `my_utilities` -- Contains the models,configurations,tools and tools for visualization


*  `preprocessing` -- The preprocessing of the data from HRDetect model


*  `single_top_driver_gene_prediction` -- The validation experiment of classifying to frequently mutated driver gene using the feature extracted from cancer classification


*  `statistics` -- Provides the preprocessing and stratified sampling of the raw data as well as doing statistic analysis on the gene mutation in each cancer
