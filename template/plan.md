4.write the status report for next week
5.prepare for the slides for next week

* **Week 3**

1. figure out the substance(pattern) that will be used for molecular recommendation system to classify the tumor into different cancers
2. get the files from lecturer or from TCGA platform 
3. working on the workflow of the recommendation system
4. try to construct a basic recommendation system to simply clustering the tumors with the data file provided 

* **Week 4**

1.practicing on the file downloaded from TCGA platform and practicing on the tools that i am going to use
2.read the article of how to use somatic mutation to train on data and classify tumors
3.improve the workflow for the recommendation system
4.try to get the somatic mutation part of classification of the tumors done
