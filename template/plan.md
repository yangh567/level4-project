Week-by-week plan for the whole project. Update this as you go along.

## Winter semester

* **Week 1**

1.fully understand the concepts of the recommendation system（what data should I put in and train, what result should i get from training and validate
2.decide on which recommendation systems should I use(Collaborative Recommender System, Content Based Recommender System, Demographic Based Recommender System, Utility Based Recommender System, Knowledge Based Recommender System, Hybrid recommender system)
3.draw a workflow for the recommender system and provide it next week.
4.write the status report for next week
5.prepare for the slides for next week

* **Week 2**

1.read the article that supervisor provided for project and understand the clustering technique for project
2.fully understand the concepts of the recommendation system（what data should I put in and train, what result should i get from training and validate
3.comprehend the article in order to use it as literature review in the future
4.write the status report for next week
5.prepare for the slides for next week

* **Week 3**

1. figure out the substance(pattern) that will be used for molecular recommendation system to classify the tumor into different cancers
2. get the files from lecturer or from TCGA platform 
3. working on the workflow of the recommendation system
4. try to construct a basic recommendation system to simply clustering the tumors with the data file provided 

* **Week 4**

1.practicing on the file downloaded from TCGA platform and practicing on the tools that i am going to use
2.read the article of how to use somatic mutation to train on data and classify tumors
3.improve the workflow for the recommendation system
4.try to get the somatic mutation part of classification of the tumors done
 
* **Week 5**
1.looking for th method of organizing the tumor instance in data file  
2.read the article of how to use somatic mutation to train on data and classify tumors
3.try to do classification on the data using somatic mutation
4.try to get the somatic mutation part of classification of the tumors done
