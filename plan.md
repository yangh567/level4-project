Week-by-week plan for the whole project. Update this as you go along.

## Winter semester

* **Week 1**

  * fully understand the concepts of the recommendation system（what data should I put in and train, what result should i get from training and validate 
  * decide on which recommendation systems should I use(Collaborative Recommender System, Content Based Recommender System, Demographic Based Recommender System, Utility Based Recommender System, Knowledge Based Recommender System, Hybrid recommender system)
  * draw a workflow for the recommender system and provide it next week.
  * write the status report for next week
  * prepare for the slides for next week

* **Week 2**

  * read the article that supervisor provided for project and understand the clustering technique for project
